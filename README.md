# ClaudeKit Agent Skills (Free Collection)

[![ClaudeKit Agent Skills](./claudekit.png)](https://claudekit.cc)

## Repository overview
- **Purpose**: Share the free `.claude/skills/*` folders that power the open ClaudeKit workflows.
- **Source**: Mirrors the Agent Skills shipped with the **Claude Engineer** toolkit stored in [ClaudeKit.cc](https://claudekit.cc).
- **Audience**: Indie builders, startups, and teams who want a starting point for disciplined Claude Code automations.

## What lives inside `.claude/skills/*`
Each folder under `.claude/skills/` bundles:
- **Mission brief**: Opinionated instructions that keep Claude focused on shipping real work instead of generic chat.
- **Guardrails**: Step-by-step checklists and fallback actions that make outputs reviewable and auditable.
- **Integration hints**: Suggested MCP connections, file structures, and prompts so you can plug skills directly into your repositories.

The directories are intentionally human-readable. Copy a skill, tweak the text files, and commit it alongside your project—Claude Code will pick it up automatically on the next run.

## Claude Code at a glance
Recent updates make Claude Code an ideal companion for these skills:
- **Parallel web sessions**: Launch multiple coding tasks from the browser, steer them mid-flight, and let Claude open pull requests when it finishes.
- **Security-first sandboxing**: Grant scoped filesystem and network access so Claude can fetch dependencies or run tests without exposing the rest of your infrastructure.
- **On-the-go iteration**: Use the iOS preview to nudge a session while you are away from your laptop.

(See Anthropic’s [Claude Code on the web](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web) announcement and Ars Technica’s coverage of the new sandbox runtime for deeper context.)

- **`problem-solving/meta-pattern-recognition/`** - Spot patterns appearing in 3+ domains to find universal principles worth extracting.
- **`problem-solving/scale-game/`** - Test at extremes (1000x bigger/smaller, instant/year-long) to expose fundamental truths hidden at normal scales.
- **`problem-solving/simplification-cascades/`** - Find one insight that eliminates multiple components. "If this is true, we don't need X, Y, or Z."
- **`problem-solving/when-stuck/`** - Dispatch to the right problem-solving technique based on your specific type of stuck-ness.

### 🔧 Meta Skills
- **`skill-creator/`** - Guide for creating effective skills with specialized workflows, tool integrations, domain expertise, and bundled resources.

## Getting started
