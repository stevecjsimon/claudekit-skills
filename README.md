# ClaudeKit - Agent Skills

## Repository overview
- **Purpose**: Share the free `.claude/skills/*` folders that power the open ClaudeKit workflows.
- **Source**: Mirrors the Agent Skills shipped with the **Claude Engineer** toolkit stored in [ClaudeKit.cc](https://claudekit.cc).
- **Audience**: Indie builders, startups, and teams who want a starting point for disciplined Claude Code automations.

## What lives inside `.claude/skills/*`
Each folder under `.claude/skills` bundles:
- **Mission brief**: Opinionated instructions that keep Claude focused on shipping real work instead of generic chat.
- **Guardrails**: Step-by-step checklists and fallback actions that make outputs reviewable and auditable.
- **Integration hints**: Suggested MCP connections, file structures, and prompts so you can plug skills directly into your repositories.

The directories are intentionally human-readable. Copy a skill, tweak the text files, and commit it alongside your project‚ÄîClaude Code will pick it up automatically on the next run.

## Claude Code at a glance
Recent updates make Claude Code an ideal companion for these skills:
- **Parallel web sessions**: Launch multiple coding tasks from the browser, steer them mid-flight, and let Claude open pull requests when it finishes.
- **Security-first sandboxing**: Grant scoped filesystem and network access so Claude can fetch dependencies or run tests without exposing the rest of your infrastructure.
- **On-the-go iteration**: Use the iOS preview to nudge a session while you are away from your laptop.
